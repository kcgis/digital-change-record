# Kendall County Digital Change Record Viewer

The files in this repository define the configuration of the [Digital Change Record](https://maps.co.kendall.il.us/digital-change-record/).

On their own, these files won't actually do anything. They are the config and assets used by Esri's [Experience Builder](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources), and are meant to be used by that program.

In order to use this Experience in your own instance of EB, simply clone the repo into your EB's `/server/public/apps` directory. When you connect to EB, you will now see this app in your list of available Experiences.
